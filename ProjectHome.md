This project will focus on creating a Payflow module for [PrestaShop](http://www.prestashop.com/).

This is not a Web Payments Pro module or standard Paypal API as can be found in [PrestaShop](http://www.prestashop.com/) 1.2.1.

The need for this module arose because our company has website payments standard and we pay for [Payflow](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_payflow-pro-overview-outside).  [Payflow](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_payflow-pro-overview-outside) supports an https method for card authorization.
